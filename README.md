### Description

![alt text](https://github.com/mastermh/Mass-Translator/blob/main/Presentation.png?raw=true)

This program is my dream dictionary that uses multiple databases.
It allows us to have synonyms, persian meanings, definitions and examples of a words list from the best databases (at least in my opinion) in the market.
This program uses <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/">Thesaurus</a> for synonyms, <a href="https://fastdic.com/">Fastdic</a> for persian meanings and <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/">Cambridge Dictionary</a> for definitions and examples.
